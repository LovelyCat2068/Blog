                <p>Saw it today with my kids and they loved it.You should have a minimal previous understanding of the movies or you’ll miss 40% of the fun.At minimum:Infinity WarCivil WarBlack PantherAge ofAnt Man and the WaspProblem is that the whole movie is homage to all movies. Yet you will enjoy it a lot.There is at the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. But most is comic book style figand battles.Must go to bathroom just before the movie because ut does last 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>

                <p>Bottom Line: The film will bring back the magic for your t(w)een, who was a fan of the original. But, it could be too intense for preschoolers. There are some spoilers below in the full review. Full Review: While it had some great songs, and I thought better instrumental music, I still like the music from the original better. The reprise of "Into the Unknown" at the end of the movie is sung by Panic! At the Disco - clearly meant to appeal to the original Frozen fans, who are now tweens and teens.</p>

Then, on Harry's eleventh birthday, a great beetle-eyed giant of a man called Rubeus Hagrid bursts in with some astonishing news: Harry Potter is a wizard, and he has a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. An incredible adventure is about to begin!
